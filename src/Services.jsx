        <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>

        <p>Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to
            make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.

            Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use depends on
            the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.

            Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great career
            option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional university
            degree to become qualified.

            The field of web development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end
            (the server side). Let’s delve into the details.</p>

                    delve into the details.</span></p>
            <h2><b>Comparing Front-End and Back-End Development</b></h2>
            <p><span ><strong>A front-end dev takes care of layout, design and
                        interactivity</strong> using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They take an idea from the drawing board
                    and turn it into reality. </span></p>
            <p><span >What you see and what you use, such as the visual aspect of the website,
                    the drop down menus and the text, are all brought together by the front-end dev, who writes a series
                    of programmes to bind and structure the elements, make them look good and add interactivity. These
                    programmes are run through a browser.</span></p>
            <p><strong>The backend developer engineers what is going on behind the scenes.</strong> This is where the
                data is stored, and without this data, there would be no frontend. The backend of the web consists of
                the server that hosts the website, an application for running it and a database to contain the data.</p>
            <p>The backend dev uses computer programmes to ensure that the server, the application and the database run
                smoothly together. This type of dev need to analyse what a company’s needs are and provide efficient
                programming solutions. To do all this amazing stuff they use a variety of server-side languages, like
                PHP, Ruby, Python and Java.</p>
            <h2><b>What about Full-Stack Development?</b></h2>
            <p>If both Frontend and Backend development appeal to you, you could consider becoming a Full-Stack
                Developer.</p>
            <p>Full-stackers take care of both the front-end and the back-end, and need to know how the web works on all
                levels, in order to determine how the client- and server-sides will relate. Naturally working up to this
                level of expertise will take longer, as there is more to learn.</p>

        <h3>It Depends.</h3>
        <p>Whether you’re looking to begin coding as a hobby, a new career, or just to enhance your current role, the
            first thing you’ll have to do is decide which programming language you want to start with.

            There is no right answer, of course. Choosing a first language will depend on what kind of projects you want
            to work on, who you want to work for, or how easy you want it to be. Hopefully, this guide will help give
            you a better idea of which one you should pursue.</p>

        <h3>Lets Know about some languages.</h3>
        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>Python is always recommended if you’re looking for an easy and even fun programming language to learn first.
            Rather than having to jump into strict syntax rules, Python reads like English and is simple to understand
            for someone who’s new to programming. This allows you to obtain a basic knowledge of coding practices
            without having to obsess over smaller details that are often important in other languages.

            Python also is ideal for web development, graphic user interfaces (GUIs), and software development. In fact,
            it was used to build Instagram, YouTube, and Spotify, so it’s clearly in demand among employers in addition
            to having a faster onboarding.

            Though it has it’s advantages, Python is often thought of as a slow language that requires more testing and
            is not as practical for developing mobile apps as other languages.</p>

            Best programming language to learn first

            Whether you’re looking to begin coding as a hobby, a new career, or just to enhance your current role, the
            first thing you’ll have to do is decide which programming language you want to start with.

            There is no right answer, of course. Choosing a first language will depend on what kind of projects you want
            to work on, who you want to work for, or how easy you want it to be. Hopefully, this guide will help give
            you a better idea of which one you should pursue.

            Python
            Python is always recommended if you’re looking for an easy and even fun programming language to learn first.
            Rather than having to jump into strict syntax rules, Python reads like English and is simple to understand
            for someone who’s new to programming. This allows you to obtain a basic knowledge of coding practices

            Python also is ideal for web development, graphic user interfaces (GUIs), and software development. In fact,
            it was used to build Instagram, YouTube, and Spotify, so it’s clearly in demand among employers in addition
            to having a faster onboarding.

            Though it has it’s advantages, Python is often thought of as a slow language that requires more testing and
            is not as practical for developing mobile apps as other languages.

            C#
            While C is one of the more difficult languages to learn, it’s still an excellent first language pick up
            because almost all programming languages are implemented in it. This means that once you learn C, it’ll be
            simple to learn more languages like C++ and C#.

            Because C is more “machine-level”, learning it is great for teaching you how a computer functions. Software
            Developer Joel Spolsky compares it to understanding basic anatomy before becoming a medical doctor, making
            it the best way to code efficiently.

            In this way, C is an exceptional choice to become a master coder and a talented developer from the get-go if
            you’re willing to take on the challenge.

            Java
            Java is an object-oriented and feature-heavy programming language that’s in high demand. It’s been built
            under the premise of “Write once, run anywhere,” meaning that it can be written on any device and work
            cross-platform.

            This makes it one of the most desired (yes, we mean high-paid) language skills. So, if you’re looking to
            learn a language that’s going to get you a great career, this might be the one, especially since top
            employers for Java programmers including Ebay, Amazon, and IBM.

            Additionally, Java is often used for Android and iOS app development, as it’s the basis of the Android
            operating system, which makes it one of the best choices if you want to build mobile apps.

            While it may not be as easy to pick up as Python, Java is a high-level language, and so it’s still
            relatively beginner-friendly. However, it has a slow startup and will take beginners much longer to deploy
            their first project.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h2>C </h2>
        <p>While C is one of the more difficult languages to learn, it’s still an excellent first language pick up
            because almost all programming languages are implemented in it. This means that once you learn C, it’ll be
            simple to learn more languages like C++ and C#.

            Because C is more “machine-level”, learning it is great for teaching you how a computer functions. Software

            In this way, C is an exceptional choice to become a master coder and a talented developer from the get-go if
            you’re willing to take on the challenge.</p>
        <br></br>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is another incredibly popular language. Many websites that you use every day rely on JavaScript
            including Twitter, Gmail, Spotify, Facebook, and Instagram according to General Assembly.

            Additionally, it’s a must-have when adding interactivity to websites because it communicates with HTML and
            CSS. This makes it essential for front-end development and consumer-facing websites while becoming
            increasingly important in back-end development and growing in demand all the time. Because of its
            popularity, JavaScript is also the leading the charge in test automation frameworks, being the backbone of
            frameworks like Protractor and Nightwatch.JS.

            There’s nothing to install with JavaScript since it’s already built into browsers, so it’s the easiest
            language to get started with in terms of set-up. The con here is that this means it’s interpreted
            differently across browsers (you’ll need to do some extra cross-browser testing) and may have deficiencies
            in responsive design compared to server-side scripts.

            Again, while it’s not the most difficult to learn, it certainly isn’t as easy as Python. If Javascript does
            seem difficult at first, try out this Javascript tutorial that’s so easy a cat could do it.</p>

        <br></br>
        <h2>Ruby</h2>
        <p>Ruby is similar to Python in that it’s one of the easiest languages for people with no prior programming
            experience to read. You don’t need to know a ton of commands or programming vocabulary to learn it, and it
            has a multitude of libraries and tools that come in handy.

            A big reason people like Ruby is because of the awesome full-stack framework, Ruby on Rails, which is
            becoming increasingly popular among startups and enterprise solutions. Airbnb, Groupon, Hulu, and Soundcloud
            are just a few of the websites that were built with Ruby on Rails, and Ruby has quite the active developer
            community today.

            The reason it’s so popular for small businesses, however, is often one of the many criticisms against it.
            Ruby can have the challenge of scalability across a large system and may have a hard time with performance
            on larger websites. Additionally, while Ruby is certainly easy to learn, you’ll find most of the
            opportunities come from learning Ruby on Rails, which may slow down your learning curve if you were just
            expecting to take the easy way out to create a website.</p>
